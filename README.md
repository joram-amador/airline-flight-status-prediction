# Title: Airline Flight Status Prediction

# Overview
This project will use machine learning techniques learned in ML Kaggle courses to build a model to predict * a flight's status * using passanger and flight information. 

The goal of this project is to demonstate a machine learning workflow and set up for future operational decision making work.

# Problem
Flight delays and cancellations create many operational and customer issues for airlines. Being able to predict flight status can be beneficial for better scheduling, allocation of resources, and strategizing for fewer delays and cancellations.

# Dataset
This airline dataset is a synthetic dataset created by Sourav Banerjee and can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamsouravbanerjee/airline-dataset.

Features:
Passenger ID - Unique identifier for each passenger
First Name - First name of the passenger
Last Name - Last name of the passenger
Gender - Gender of the passenger
Age - Age of the passenger
Nationality - Nationality of the passenger
Airport Name - Name of the airport where the passenger boarded
Airport Country Code - Country code of the airport's location
Country Name - Name of the country the airport is located in
Airport Continent - Continent where the airport is situated
Continents - Continents involved in the flight route
Departure Date - Date when the flight departed
Arrival Airport - Destination airport of the flight
Pilot Name - Name of the pilot operating the flight
Flight Status - Current status of the flight

# Target
Flight Status (classification):
- On Time
- Delayed
- Cancelled

# Evaluation Metric
The metric chosen for the start is accuracy since the target is categorical and accuracy gives a clear benchmark for the model. However, other metrics will be explored in the future.

# Steps:
1. Exploratory Data Analysis
2. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
3. Feature Engineering
4. Baseline Models
5. Cross-Validation
6. Hyperparameter Tuning
7. Gradient Boosting
8. Feature Importance Analysis
9. Model Interpretation & Communication
